### Factory Method

- It has a method that is used to instantiate an object from one among set of classes based on some logic.
- This patterns is also known as virtual constructors pattern.


###### When to use this pattern?

- When a class canâ€™t guess the type of the objects it is supposed to create.
- When a class wants its subclasses to be the ones to specific the type of a newly created object.
- When we want to localize the knowledge of which class gets created.
